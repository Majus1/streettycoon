- Continue work on the scrollable section.
    - Make the intersection observer look for all 4 sections.
    - Make the observer work when he sees a section (Show hide image).
- Make it scroll magic.
- Make it responsive.


Just some mind notes
- Majbe you but a iner signal section inside on top of the scrolable area and listen for it
- Or maybe you could play around a bit with the root margin? Perhaps?

// In both cases above you have one multiple intersection observers observing
